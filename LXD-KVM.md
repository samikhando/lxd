# LXD-KVM project

## Usage

### Building
Build the whole thing with `make`.
Binaries are stored in `$GOPATH/bin`, both lxc and lxd.

### Running
Make sure that your global lxd installation is not running, then run lxd binary.
Then run lxc:
```
sudo $GOPATH/bin/lxc launch <full path to image> --kvm
```
